# Reinforcement-learning

- This is a straightforward implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game by a Q-learning algorithm using a neural network for the action-value function evaluation.

- The neural network is implemented in Keras using TensorFlow backend.

- To run in interactive mode, run from command line: python TTT_RL_Interactive.py 
(need to have 'NN_TTT_model_2.h5' in current folder)

- To run and train your own network run: python TTT_RL.py train
